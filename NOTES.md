# MobilePitStop website — working notes

Code for the service pages on mobilepitstop.uk. Each `.txt` file is the

are the price finders; "Whats Included" files are the content below them.

## 2026-10-01 — In & Out Deep Clean questionnaire fixed

File: `In & Out Deep Clean Questionnaire.txt`

### Ceramic coating now works like Exterior Detail
- Question 6 offers 6-month sealant, ceramic coating **1 / 3 / 7 years**,
  or no add-on.
- Picking a coating carries on to the extras (question 7). The
  "Front Windows Coating" extra is hidden because the coating includes it.
- The final button reads **Request This Booking**. It opens the
  WhatsApp / email request with the full quote filled in. The deposit box
  is hidden and a dry-weather note is shown instead.
- Choosing sealant or "No add-on" (or changing an earlier answer) clears
  the coating, and the button goes back to **View Calendar**.

### Bugs fixed
1. A stray `</div>` after the coating card broke the page structure, so
   the extras and final screens fell outside the questionnaire.
2. The request panel (`#iodRequest`) was never closed, so the calendar was
   inside it. The panel is hidden until a coating is chosen, so the
   calendar never showed.
3. Leftover booking CSS copied from Exterior Detail kept only that page's
   step 5 visible, which hid this page's booking step (step 7) when the
   calendar opened. Removed; the correct copy was already further down.
4. `depositAmount()` was defined twice; the second ignored the discount
   code, so the 10% deposit was on the full price. The duplicate is
   removed and the "remaining balance" text uses the discounted total.
5. The Stripe deposit label sent a literal `&amp;` and never listed
   add-ons. It now reads "In & Out Deep Clean" and lists seat protection,
   clay / enhancement and sealant.
6. Analytics sent `odour: undefined`; now sends the real odour extra.
7. Header comment described Interior Deep Clean; rewritten for In & Out.

### Checked in a browser
- 3-door, leather seats treated, clay, 1-year coating → **£300**, button
  "Request This Booking", request form opens with the quote.
- Same without coating → **£210**, "View Calendar", calendar opens.

## Open issues (not fixed yet)

- **Two Exterior Detail files.** `Exterior Detail Questionnaire.txt` is the
  live one. `Exterior Detail.txt` is an older version and could be deleted.
- **Interior Deep Clean prices don't match its notes.** The header says
  £100 / £120 / £140 with 48 Acuity types and an `ACUITY_TYPE_MAP`, but the
  code still has `BASE_PRICES` £90 / £100 / £120 and no `ACUITY_TYPE_MAP`.
  The new pricing looks unbuilt.
- **In & Out pricing comment vs code.** The script comment above
  `BASE_PRICES` says £100 / £110 / £120 but the prices used are
  £140 / £160 / £180. Prices were left as they are; the comment is stale.
- **Odd vehicle types on In & Out.** "Van, pick-up, minibus or camper" goes
  straight to a WhatsApp quote message, not the Acuity quote slot that
  Exterior Detail uses.
