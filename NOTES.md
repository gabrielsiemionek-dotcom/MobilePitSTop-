# MobilePitStop website — working notes

Code for the service pages on mobilepitstop.uk. Each `.txt` file is the
HTML/CSS/JS pasted into one page block on the site. "Questionnaire" files
are the price finders; "Whats Included" files are the content below them.

## 2026-10-01 — In & Out Deep Clean questionnaire fixed

File: `In & Out Deep Clean Questionnaire.txt`

### Ceramic coating now works like Exterior Detail
- Question 6 offers 6-month sealant, ceramic coating **1 / 3 / 7 years**,
  or no add-on.
- Picking a coating carries on to the extras (question 7). The
  "Front Windows Coating" extra is hidden because the coating includes it.
- The final button reads **Request This Booking**. It opens the
  WhatsApp / email request with the full quote filled in. The deposit box
  is hidden and a dry-weather note is shown instead.
- Choosing sealant or "No add-on" (or changing an earlier answer) clears
  the coating, and the button goes back to **View Calendar**.

### Bugs fixed
1. A stray `</div>` after the coating card broke the page structure, so
   the extras and final screens fell outside the questionnaire.
2. The request panel (`#iodRequest`) was never closed, so the calendar was
   inside it. The panel is hidden until a coating is chosen, so the
   calendar never showed.
3. Leftover booking CSS copied from Exterior Detail kept only that page's
   step 5 visible, which hid this page's booking step (step 7) when the
   calendar opened. Removed; the correct copy was already further down.
4. `depositAmount()` was defined twice; the second ignored the discount
   code, so the 10% deposit was on the full price. The duplicate is
   removed and the "remaining balance" text uses the discounted total.
5. The Stripe deposit label sent a literal `&amp;` and never listed
   add-ons. It now reads "In & Out Deep Clean" and lists seat protection,
   clay / enhancement and sealant.
6. Analytics sent `odour: undefined`; now sends the real odour extra.
7. Header comment described Interior Deep Clean; rewritten for In & Out.

### Checked in a browser
- 3-door, leather seats treated, clay, 1-year coating → **£300**, button
  "Request This Booking", request form opens with the quote.
- Same without coating → **£210**, "View Calendar", calendar opens.

## Confirmed base prices

| Service             | 3-door | 5-door | 7-seater |
|---------------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Interior Deep Clean | £90    | £100   | £120     |
| In & Out Deep Clean | £140   | £160   | £180     |

Both questionnaires already charge these. Interior Deep Clean's code is
correct as it stands.

### In & Out price references brought in line (2026-10-01)
- Script comment above `BASE_PRICES` said £100 / £110 / £120 → now
  £140 / £160 / £180.
- `All Services.txt` In & Out card said £140–170 → now **£140–180**.
- Already correct: header comment, size pills (£140 / £160 / £180),
  "From £140" starting total.

## 2026-10-01 — In & Out What's Included rebuilt from the correct base

File: `In & Out Deep Clean Whats Included.txt`

The first upload was the old Full Valet block. Rebuilt from the user's
In & Out draft (blue add-on styling, sealant card, 3–5 hr FAQ) and brought
in line with the questionnaire:

- **No vehicle sizes or size tables.** Size and exact price live in the
  questionnaire above; this block shows "from" prices only.
- **Seats follow the questionnaire.** Mats, carpets & boot extraction is
  included; seat treatment is an add-on (+£30 cloth, +£40 leather /
  alcantara). The draft said seats were included with stains pre-treated.
- **Sealant** +£60, clay included (+£30 if clay already paid). Removed
  "Glaco included" and "becomes a Protection Detail at the same price" —
  the questionnaire doesn't do either; Glaco is a separate £30 extra.
- **Ceramic coating** 1 / 3 / 7 years from +£120, replaces the wax, clay +
  front windows included, by request ("Request This Booking").
- **Added** (all blue, all from the questionnaire): seat treatment card +
  Seats section (treatment, protection from +£100 / +£150), Extras section
  (anti-fog £15, front windows £30, engine bay £30, ultrasonic odour £40,
  sand £50, pet hair £50).
- Add-on prices, section headings and accordions all use the blue
  add-on styling.
- Section id is `#WhatIncludedInAndOut` (the questionnaire's "See what's
  included" button points here); Book button → `#priceFinderInAndOut`.
- Removed the "How is it different from the Protection Detail?" FAQ — it
  relied on the same-price claim.
- Seat card and sealant card have no photo yet (plain panel; comment in
  each card shows where to put an image link).

## Open issues (not fixed yet)

- **Two Exterior Detail files.** `Exterior Detail Questionnaire.txt` is the
  live one. `Exterior Detail.txt` is an older version and could be deleted.
- **Interior Deep Clean header comment is stale.** The prices in the code
  (£90 / £100 / £120) are correct. The comment at the top of the file
  describes a different plan (£100 / £120 / £140, 48 Acuity types, an
  `ACUITY_TYPE_MAP` that doesn't exist) and should be rewritten to match
  the code. Nothing on the page is affected.
- **All Services page — to be updated later.** The Interior Deep Clean and
  Exterior Detail cards both say "from £60", but those pages start at £90
  and £70.
- **Odd vehicle types on In & Out.** "Van, pick-up, minibus or camper" goes
  straight to a WhatsApp quote message, not the Acuity quote slot that
  Exterior Detail uses.
